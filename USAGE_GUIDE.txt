WiFi Penetration Testing Tool - Usage Guide
=========================================

This package provides multiple GUI applications for Windows users:

1. Local Windows GUI (wifi_tool_gui.py)
   - Run with: run_gui.bat
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for running the Windows-compatible version
   - Simulates WiFi penetration testing operations

2. Simple SSH Connection GUI (simple_ssh_gui.py)
   - Run with: run_ssh_gui.bat
   - Provides SSH connectivity to your Kali Linux VM using system SSH
   - Allows execution of commands on the remote system

3. Paramiko SSH Connection GUI (paramiko_ssh_gui.py)
   - Run with: run_paramiko_ssh_gui.bat
   - Provides SSH connectivity to your Kali Linux VM using Python paramiko library
   - Full-featured SSH implementation with better error handling

Initial Setup:
=============
1. Run setup_complete.bat to install required dependencies
2. Make sure your Kali Linux VM is running and accessible
3. Verify network connectivity to the VM (172.18.0.1)

Using the Local Windows GUI:
===========================
1. Double-click run_gui.bat
2. The GUI has two tabs:
   - Local Windows: For running the Windows-compatible version
   - Kali Linux SSH: For SSH connectivity (simulated in this version)
3. Enter interface details and run scans, captures, or cracking operations

Using the Simple SSH GUI:
========================
1. Double-click run_ssh_gui.bat
2. Verify the connection details:
   - Host: 172.18.0.1 (your Kali VM)
   - Username: vaptrix
   - Password: Xevyte@2025
   - Port: 22 (default SSH port)
3. Click "Test Connection" to verify network connectivity
4. Click "Show SSH Command" to get the SSH command for manual use
5. Enter commands in the command field and click "Execute via SSH"
6. Use the quick command buttons for common operations

Using the Paramiko SSH GUI:
==========================
1. Double-click run_paramiko_ssh_gui.bat
2. Verify the connection details:
   - Host: 172.18.0.1 (your Kali VM)
   - Username: vaptrix
   - Password: Xevyte@2025
   - Port: 22 (default SSH port)
3. Click "Connect" to establish SSH connection
4. Once connected, enter commands in the command field and click "Execute"
5. Use the quick command buttons for common operations
6. This version provides better error handling and feedback

Troubleshooting Network Issues:
==============================
If you cannot connect to your Kali VM:

1. Check if the VM is running
2. Verify the IP address (172.18.0.1) is correct
3. Check network settings (Bridged/NAT/Host-only adapter)
4. Ensure SSH is enabled on the Kali VM:
   - sudo systemctl status ssh
   - sudo systemctl start ssh (if not running)
5. Check Windows Firewall settings
6. Try pinging the VM from Windows command prompt:
   - ping 172.18.0.1

Kali Linux VM Configuration:
===========================
To ensure your Kali VM is properly configured:

1. SSH Service:
   - sudo systemctl status ssh
   - sudo systemctl start ssh (if not running)
   - sudo systemctl enable ssh (to start automatically)

2. Network Tools:
   - Ensure aircrack-ng suite is installed:
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install aircrack-ng

3. Python Dependencies:
   - The penetration testing tool should be in the home directory
   - Make sure it's properly installed and configured

Connecting Manually via SSH:
===========================
If you prefer to connect manually:

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Run: ssh vaptrix@172.18.0.1
3. Enter password: Xevyte@2025
4. Navigate to the tool directory and run commands

Running Penetration Testing Commands:
====================================
Once connected to your Kali VM:

1. Navigate to the tool directory:
   cd wifi_penetration_tool

2. Run a basic scan:
   sudo python3 main.py

3. Run with specific options:
   sudo python3 main.py -i wlan1
   sudo python3 main.py -t 00:11:22:33:44:55 -c 6
   sudo python3 main.py -d /path/to/wordlist.txt
   sudo python3 main.py --use-fern

Security Notes:
==============
- Only use these tools on networks you own or have explicit permission to test
- Be aware of legal implications in your jurisdiction
- Use responsibly and ethically
- Keep credentials secure and change default passwords
